// will signal to the caller that they need to communicate with the registry to find a new
// activation location for the actor.
//
// In terms of actually evicting the actors from memory, the method does not currently
// implement that functionality directly. Instead it simply waits for the existing GC mechanism
// to kick in which evicts actors from memories once they haven't received any invocations
// for a period of time (which is guaranteed to happen because of the blacklist cache). However,
// this is not ideal because it indirectly links the server's ability to shed actor's that are
// using too much memory with the TTL for evicting idle actors. This is also problematic because
// it means that repeated invocations of shedMemUsage will have no effect until all the actors
// from previous invocations have been GC'd due to idleness which makes balancing slower than it

		// This is counter intuitive, but when we want to shed actors to reduce memory usage we
		// start by first shedding the actors using the *lowest* amount of memory instead of the
		// *highest*.
		//
		// The reasons for this are:
		//
		//   1. Shedding low memory usage actors is less likely to result in "flapping". Imagine
		//      the server has 1000 actors on it where 999 are using very little memory and one
		//      actor is using many GiB. If we shed the highest memory usage actor, it will get
		//      reactivated shortly on another server and then perhaps soon shed from there as
		//      well resulting in a form of "ping-pong" flopping. However, if we shed the lowest
		//      memory usage actor firsts, they're much likely to "bin-pack" nicely into the other
		//      servers without flapping. This effectively results in a model where instead of
		//      trying to bin-pack high memory actors we instead try to bin-pack low memory actors
		//      and isolate high memory actors by "draining away" all other actors and in the most
		//      extreme case leaving the high memory usage actor isolated on its own dedicated
		//      server.
		//   2. Intuitively an actor that is using a lot of memory will likely take a long time to
		//      "snapshot" and subsequently "rehydrate" when it is moved to a different server. Or,
		//      another way to think about it, is that a high memory actor has accumulated more
		//      "state". A single actor can only snapshot/rehydrated single-threaded, so we can move
		//      actors and load-balance faster if we instead move a higher number of low-memory
		//      actors instead of a lower number of high-memory actors because there are significantly
		//      more opportunities for parallelism so we can use more CPU time to keep actor migration
		//      *wall clock* time lower.
		//
		// The downside of this approach though is obviously that it requires moving/disrupting more
		// actors. However, for the current situations NOLA is used for we believe this is the right
		// trade off.
		//
		// TODO: We could consider some kind of hybrid approach where we try and move the high memory
		//       usage actors first, but only those are that are below some threshold of memory usage.
		//       For example if the threshold was 1GiB and the top actors used:
		//           [15GiB, 8GiB, 900MiB, 500MiB, 400MiB, 50MiB, 25MiB]
		//       Then we would ignore the first two actors and begin by draining the 900 and 500 MiB
		//       actors. Then if we ran out of actors to drain from the topN, we would start iterating
		//       the bottomN. I have not put a ton of thought into it, but this might work a lot better
		//       in scenarios where there are many actors and draining the bottom N results in tons of
